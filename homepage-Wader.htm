								<span class="style4">My stories aim to improve

								Perspective</span><span class="style3"><span class="style4"><span class="style2"><br />
								<br />
								</span>I&#39;m writing from the perspective of 
								someone who believes that three serious errors 
								need to be corrected.&nbsp; In short:<br />
								<br />
								</span><span class="style12"><em>1. It&#39;s 
								important to recognize that the third possible 
								worldview, expressed by Baruch Spinoza is the 
								true one.</em></span></span></strong><span class="style12"><span class="style3"><em>

								<span class="style12"><em><br />
								</em></span></strong></span>
								<span class="style4"></span>
								<span class="style3"><strong>
								<span class="style12"><em>2. It is important to 
								raise awareness that humanity participates in 
								the recurring rebirth of the world — this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the true purpose and meaning of life. <br />
								</em></span></strong></span>
								<span class="style4"></span>
								<span class="style3"><strong>

								</span><strong><span class="style11">About My 
								Work</span><span class="style3"><span class="style4"><br />
								<br />
								I have published many academic texts under my 
								real name, most of them peer-reviewed and 
								interdisciplinary in character. <br />
								<br />
								I have also written several popular science 
								books.<br />
								<br />
								For many years, I have also been creating 
								fictional works that are novelistic in form and 
								almost ready-made as film scripts, often 
								structured around dialogues.<br />
